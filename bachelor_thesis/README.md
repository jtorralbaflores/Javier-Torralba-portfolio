Title: The effects of shocks in leisure time on book consumption: evidence from Goodreads
Supervisor: Lachlan Deer
Second Reader: Elena Cettolin
Result: 8.5/10

## Summary
For my bachelor thesis, I studied the effect of COVID restrictions on the way users of the platform Goodreads consume books. 
Lachlan Deer was my supervisor. This was ideal since I also worked as a Research Assistant for him on this same project. 
The results of my thesis show that Goodreads users' book consumption was not affected by light restrictions, and as COVID restrictions
grew harsher, people consumed more books. They did this in the form of more pages and books read in a shorter time. Higher restrictions
also made users read older books. Restrictions did not impact the way users rated a book.
