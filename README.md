# Javier-Torralba-portfolio
Hello, and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Javier Torralba, and I am an MSc Data Science and Society student and BSc Economics graduate, both at Tilburg University. Here, you can find some of
my academic work and some of my professional work as a research assistant. Here's a summary and overview of the directories in this repository. 

## BSc Economics thesis
For my bachelor thesis, I studied the effects of COVID restrictions on the way people consume leisure goods, specifically books. For this, I used an extensive dataset from the platform Goodreads (about 
6.5 million observations and 39 variables). I applied an OLS fixed effects model to conduct this research. My research shows that after controlling for several fixed effects, on average, Goodreads users read more book, pages, and more quickly as COVID restrictions increase. 
Light COVID restrictions do not have a significant effect on any of these three variables, but as restrictions increase, these effects are significantly magnified, up to, on average, 
reading 11% and around 14% quicker during periods of very high restrictions. Also, after controlling for several fixed effects, on average, people read older books when COVID restrictions are at their highest,
with books read during high restriction periods being about 5.5% older on average. Finally, COVID restrictions do not affect the way people rate the same book, which is likely to apply to other products
that are not books. 

You can find all the code and visualizations I used to do my thesis under the folder "bachelor_thesis". In this folder you can find an overview of my thesis along with more details about it. You can also find
my thesis in this directory. I hope you enjoy it!

## Work as a research assistant
I currently work for the Tilburg Science Hub as a research assistant. I collaborate with quantitative marketing professors in their research, most of them in the very early stages of their research.
I am used to working with huge datasets hovering around several millions of observations. I am used to wrangling, visualizing, and modeling large datasets.
