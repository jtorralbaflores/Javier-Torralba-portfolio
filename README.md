Hello, and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Javier Torralba, and I am an MSc Data Science and Society student and BSc Economics graduate, both at Tilburg University. Here, you can find some of
my academic work and some of my professional work as a research assistant. Here's a summary and overview of the directories in this repository. 

## MSc Data Science Thesis - Predicting popularity on Instagram: Integrating deep learning, machine learning, and explainable AI for enhanced social media analytics

Grade: 8/10

In an era where social media platforms like Instagram influence
economic and societal outcomes, accurately predicting the popularity
of posts becomes essential. This thesis investigates the potential of
integrating deep learning and machine learning models to forecast
the popularity of Instagram posts before they are published. This research can be summarised in how integrating deep learning, machine
learning, and explainable AI techniques optimizes the prediction
and understanding of Instagram post popularity, considering diverse
data features and error dynamics. Obtaining a sample of 133,642
posts from 27,893 different users, I used a ResNet50 pre-trained on
ImageNet and a BERT model pre-trained on Twitter data to extract
image and text features. Different sets of features, including images,
text, and user features, are tested on three different algorithms: XGBoost, Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), and Deep Neural
Networks. The best-performing algorithm, LGBM, used all features
and achieved an F1 score of about 69%. An error analysis shows that
the error rate depends on the predicted probability value made by
the model. SHAP values reveal that the number of followers and
posts are the most influential in predicting the popularity of a post,
yet image and text features can have a stronger predictive value together. Combining the best-performing model, domain knowledge,
error analysis, and SHAP values can help Instagram users make
data-driven decisions to post the most engaging content.

Grade: 8.5/10

For my bachelor thesis, I studied the effects of COVID restrictions on the way people consume leisure goods, specifically books. For this, I used an extensive dataset from the platform Goodreads (about 
6.5 million observations and 39 variables). I applied an OLS fixed effects model to conduct this research. My research shows that after controlling for several fixed effects, on average, Goodreads users read more book, pages, and more quickly as COVID restrictions increase. 
Light COVID restrictions do not have a significant effect on any of these three variables, but as restrictions increase, these effects are significantly magnified, up to, on average, 
reading 11% and around 14% quicker during periods of very high restrictions. Also, after controlling for several fixed effects, on average, people read older books when COVID restrictions are at their highest,
with books read during high restriction periods being about 5.5% older on average. Finally, COVID restrictions do not affect the way people rate the same book, which is likely to apply to other products
that are not books. 

You can find all the code and visualizations I used to do my thesis under the folder "bachelor_thesis". In this folder you can find an overview of my thesis along with more details about it. You can also find
my thesis in this directory. I hope you enjoy it!

## Work as a research assistant
I currently work for the Tilburg Science Hub as a research assistant. I collaborate with quantitative marketing professors in their research, most of them in the very early stages of their research.
I am used to working with huge datasets hovering around several millions of observations. I am used to wrangling, visualizing, and modeling large datasets. At the moment I am pending approval on publishing more of 
my work on this projects, which is difficult since most of this involve sensitive data and are in early stages of their research.
