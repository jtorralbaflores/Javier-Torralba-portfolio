For this project, I helped professor Lachlan Deer visualize the proportion of political ads in Spanish per DMA and political party in the United States
for all presidential and non-presidential federal elections in he U.S from 2014 to 2018. You can find the visualizations and the markdown file 
that make this visualizations in this folder.
